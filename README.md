# m6803 Plugin

Motorola 6803 plugin for [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/)

Includes a default Binary View that will detect the [Roland TR 707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-707) Program rom (based on the first 6 bytes) to make it easier to RE the 707.

**This still doesn't do anything at all useful**

## Todo

- [ ] Implement entire 6803 Instruction Set
- [ ] Implement LLIL methods
- [ ] Map 707 Ram and Memory Registers
- [ ] Hack a 707 and see if this even worked.

Opcode Count: **11/221**
